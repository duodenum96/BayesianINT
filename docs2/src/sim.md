# Simulation Based Timescale Estimation

There are four main functions in INT.jl to perform simulation based timescale estimation: `one_timescale_model`, `one_timescale_and_osc_model`, `one_timescale_with_missing_model`, `one_timescale_and_osc_with_missing_model`. All have similar syntax with differences in implementation. I will detail the usage of `one_timescale_model`. For the other models, I won't go into as much detail but point out the fundamental differences from `one_timescale_model`. For more details, refer the [Practice] section. 

## `one_timescale_model`
