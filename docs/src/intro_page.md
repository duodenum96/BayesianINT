# INT.jl Documentation

Welcome to the documentation of INT.jl. INT.jl is a software package for estimating 
Intrinsic Neural Timescales (INTs) from time-series data. It uses model-free methods 
(ACW-50, ACW-0, fitting an exponential decay function etc.) and simulation-based
methods (ABC, ADVI) to estimate INTs.

## Installation

This package is written in Julia. If you do not have Julia installed, you can install it from 
[here](https://julialang.org/downloads/). Once you have Julia installed, you can install INT.jl by running the following command in the Julia REPL:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("INT")
```
Soon, there will also be a Python wrapper called [INTpy](https://github.com/duodenum96/INTpy), 
which will allow you to use INT.jl from Python. 

## Quickstart

INT.jl uses two ways to estimate INTs: model-free methods and simulation-based inference. 
Model-free methods include ACW-50, ACW-0, ACW-e, decay rate of an exponential fit to ACF and 
knee freqency of a lorentzian fit to PSD. Simulation-based methods are based on [Zeraati 
et al. (2022)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-022-00214-3) paper and do parameter 
estimation by assuming the data came from an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. For estimation, in addition 
to the aABC method used in [Zeraati et al. (2022)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-022-00214-3), 
we also present ADVI. 

For model-free methods, simply use 

```julia
using INT
acwresults = acw(data, fs; acwtypes = [:acw0, :acw50, :acweuler, :tau, :knee]), dims=ndims(data))
```

where `fs` is sampling frequency, optional parameters `acwtypes` is a vector of 
symbols (indicated with `:`) telling which methods to use and `dims` is indicating the dimension 
of time in your array (by default, the last dimension). The resulting `acwresults` gives the 
results in the same order of `acwtypes`. 

For simulation based methods, pick one of the `one_timescale_model`, `one_timescale_with_missing_model`, 
`one_timescale_and_osc_model` and `one_timescale_and_osc_with_missing_model` functions. These models 
correspond to different generative models depending on whether there is an oscillation or not. For each 
generative model, there are with or without missing variants which use different ways to calculate 
ACF and PSD. Once you pick the model, the syntax is 

```julia
model = one_timescale_model(data, time, :abc)
result = solve(model)
```

or 

```julia
model = one_timescale_model(data, time, :advi)
result = solve(model)
```

to pick a method. These functions are highly customizable, see the page [Simulation Based Methods]. 

## Where to go from here?

This documentation is divided in three parts. The third part [API] is an exhaustive list of 
functions and their signatures of the package. It is boring but like many boring things, good for you. 
The first part is [Practice](@ref). It is usually easier 
to understand something after you do it, therefore, I placed the practice section before theory. 
In [Practice](@ref), we carefully build our way towards estimating INTs by starting from the 
autocorrelation function and slowly proceeding to more and more advanced methods. 
For the users already familiar with INTs and delve into the usage of the 
package, I have two tutorials: [Using INT.jl for Timescale Estimation-1: Model-Free Methods] and [2- Simulation-Based Methods]. 
The second part is [Theory]. This part delves into the history of INT research, what it means in the brain and what it is good for with a particular emphasis on theoretical research, summarizing 
the cutting edge in this frontier. It is especially useful for researchers working on INT itself. 


## Contributions

Contributions are welcome. Use the 
[issues section of our github page](https://github.com/duodenum96/INT.jl/issues) 
to report bugs, make feature requests, ask questions or 
tackle the issues by making pull requests. 

This package is developed by me, [Yasir Ã‡atal](https://github.com/duodenum96) during my PhD. I am 
doing my PhD on INTs and [our lab](https://www.georgnorthoff.com) is specialized on the topic. As a result, 
I had many conversations with [almost every member](https://www.georgnorthoff.com/researchers) 
of our lab about INTs. I designed this documentation while keeping those conversations in mind. 
My goal was not only to document the package, but also to build up the knowledge to really grasp 
the concept of INTs especially for new researchers starting their journey and active researchers in the 
trenches if they wish to brush up their basics.
